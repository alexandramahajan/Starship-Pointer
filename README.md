# Starship-Pointer

ðŸš€ A machine learning co-pilot for your next planetary adventure. 

The Starship Pointer is a machine learning tool designed to classify exoplanets based on key astrophysical features, using a supervised learning model trained on data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive.

This project uses a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier to predict the likely planet type (e.g., terrestrial, gas giant) based on measurable parameters such as planetary radius and mass, orbital period, and eccentricity.

With ~95% classification accuracy on validation data, the Starship Pointer enables rapid assessment of nearby planetary systemsâ€”whether for research, education, or space-themed exploration tools.
